Regression losses quantify the dissimilarity between predicted values and actual target values in regression analysis, where the goal is to predict a continuous target variable. Common regression losses include Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Huber Loss, R^2 and others.

The output of regression models is a numerical value representing a quantity or a continuous variable, such as predicting house prices, temperature, or stock prices.
